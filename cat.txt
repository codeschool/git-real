Schr√∂dinger's first name was Erwin.  He was from Vienna, Austria.  He is probably best known for a thought experiment regarding the existence and/or death of a theoretical cat inside a box in which a vial of poison is broken open.  

Until you choose to open the box and actually look at the health of the cat in question, said animal can be considered both alive and dead.
