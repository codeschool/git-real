Git is great!

Why?

It allows communication and file sharing for projects between terminals as long as both have Git installed.

Windows users can <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">download Git here.</a>

Mac OS X has Git pre-installed, but it can be upgraded and maintained with <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a> - the OS X package manager.

Linux users can install Homebrew for Linux <a href="http://linuxbrew.sh/" target="_blank">here</a>.

PROJECT-RELATED CONVERSATIONAL CONSPIRACY THEORIES

**************************************************

The cake is a lie.

How do you know; does the frosting say it's a lie?  Where is your proof?

I don't need proof.

Yes, you do.  You sound ridiculous, otherwise.  Open to ridicule.

I don't care about ridicule.

...Lucky you.  I think the cake is truthful.

...Why?

Really, are you serious?  It just says 'Happy Birthday!', there's nothing else it needs to say.  It's a birthday cake; no alterior motives.

...None that you know about...

*stares*  Oh-kay.  Yeah, I'm going to just let you talk.  I'll just listen.

Thank you.

No problem, you're welcome.
