Git is great!

Why?

It allows communication and file sharing for projects between terminals as long as both have Git installed.

The cake is a lie.

How do you know; does the frosting say it's a lie?  Where is your proof?

I don't need proof.

Yes, you do.  You sound ridiculous, otherwise.  Open to ridicule.

I don't care about ridicule.

...Lucky you.  I think the cake is truthful.

...Why?

Really, are you serious?  It just says 'Happy Birthday!', there's nothing else it needs to say.  It's a birthday cake; no alterior motives.

...None that you know about...

*stares*  Oh-kay.  Yeah, I'm going to just let you talk.  I'll just listen.

Thank you.
